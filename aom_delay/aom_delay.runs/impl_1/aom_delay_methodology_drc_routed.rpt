2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell signal_out_reg_i_10, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) counter_reg[0]/CLR, counter_reg[10]/CLR, counter_reg[11]/CLR, counter_reg[12]/CLR, counter_reg[13]/CLR, counter_reg[14]/CLR, counter_reg[15]/CLR, counter_reg[16]/CLR, counter_reg[17]/CLR, counter_reg[18]/CLR, counter_reg[19]/CLR, counter_reg[1]/CLR, counter_reg[20]/CLR, counter_reg[21]/CLR, counter_reg[22]/CLR (the first 15 of 27 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
